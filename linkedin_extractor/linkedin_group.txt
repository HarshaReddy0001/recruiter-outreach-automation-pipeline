Data Analyst | Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, & Agile | I help healthcare organizations drive 30%+ efficiency and ROI gains with data-driven insights.

3w • Edited • 


Follow

Last year was filled with significant experiences in my life. I was excited to complete my second graduate degree in Business Analytics. However, after graduation, nothing could have prepared me for the job hunt that consumed the second half of the year. As I write this, I am still navigating the job market. I know this is a common story for many people at the moment; as I scroll through my timeline, I see similar experiences. Despite the challenges, this season has taught me valuable lessons that I am carrying into the year.

✅ Being Consistent  
There were days when I felt like giving up, but I was reminded of the greater benefits of consistency. Having the right mindset and showing up, even when I don’t feel like it, truly matters. Little progress is still progress.

✅ Keeping up the Hope 
I have reached the final stage of interviews five times. In each of those interviews, I felt confident that I had performed well; however, I still received that familiar email: "We thank you for your time." I have refused to let these moments define who I am and remain hopeful that the right opportunity will come along.

✅ The Power of Connections 
I have learned the importance of building connections. In today’s job market, it’s no longer just about what you know, but also about whom you know. I recognize that I still have room to grow in this area. Developing the right connections is something I have committed to pursuing, as having mentors can open many doors.

✅ Continuous Learning  
In a world that is constantly changing, I have come to understand the importance of adapting. Learning new skills and expanding my knowledge are goals I intend to pursue this year.

As this year progresses, I hope it will be a productive one. I am optimistic that I will secure a Data Analyst role at the right time.

By the way, here are some individuals from whom I have learned valuable insights. Feel free to follow them.
Jalonni Weaver
Avery Smith
Karolina Planica
Mandy Liu (Lead Data Scientist, Ex-Meta)
Emlyn De Leon
Silvia Wutche
Venkata Naga Sai Kumar Bysani

Wishing everyone a Happy 2026 filled with opportunities!

I was recently made aware that my profile is being used without my knowledge to promote a fraudulent Data Scientist position at PursueCare. 

This posting is not legitimate. Please avoid responding to it or clicking on any associated links. I have reported the issue and encouraged those who encountered it to do the same. The invalid email that it is coming from is dianaminelli@recruitpursuecare.team. 

Unfortunately, this is a reminder that we all have to stay alert when exploring new opportunities. If something feels off, it usually is. It’s frustrating that job seekers, especially those who are actively and urgently looking, have to navigate scams on top of everything else. Staying cautious protects not only ourselves but our entire professional community.

Immigrants in tech aren’t just job hunting. 
We’re building lives on expiring visas and hope. 

I’ve been there: refreshing emails, explaining “STEM OPT.” 

What kept me going? Community. 
Talk to people who get it. It makes the wait less lonely.

I also decided to create an Instagram account.

The goal is simple: to share the unfiltered side of being a data scientist, not only SQL cheat sheets.

I promise some unfiltered thoughts, behind-the-scenes moments, and probably a few “I have no idea what I’m doing” days too 😂

Sharing this to help protect fellow job seekers from a sophisticated scam.

I recently received what appeared to be a legitimate job interview email from someone claiming to be "Jessica Boyett, Hiring Manager" at Earthlink Wireless Corp for a Data Scientist position (email: jessica.boyett@consultant.com). The red flags: suspicious @consultant.com email domain, and a Data Scientist role at a company that doesn't match that business model.
What saved me? I came across a post by Mohsin Ali warning about this EXACT same scammer using the same name, email, and tactics with a different company (Vital Records Control). His breakdown showed that after you provide your availability, they ask for payment ($1) for a background check report, screenshots of your credit score and criminal history, and personal information before any actual interview. 
Thank you, Mohsin Ali, for posting your warning. Stay vigilant out there, job seekers. Always verify company emails match official domains, research hiring managers on LinkedIn, and trust your instincts. If something feels off, it probably is.… more

Back with Hiring Drive number 3 and this time we are hiring a bunch of entry/mid-level data scientists and data engineers. Yes there will be 2 different assessment tests/evaluation.

We’re hiring over 10 Data Scientists folks (0–3 years experience) and 30 Data Engineer folks (0-3 years experience) for our partner companies in the US — and they’re open to sponsorship (OPT, STEM-OPT, H-1B).

Yes, you read that right — all are welcome 🙌
If you’re a data scientist/data engineer with strong technical skills and excellent communication, this could be your next big opportunity.

Why this is different:
Too many great people get lost in the hiring maze — no feedback, slow response times, unclear next steps.

We’re fixing that.
Here’s what we’re solving for:
1. Speed of Hiring – no more endless waiting. Result in less than a week's time
2. Feedback For All- No matter what the result is whether you got in or not. Everyone deserves a feedback, everyone will get a detailed feedback within 48 hours of the assessment

🧠 How to Apply:

Fill out these quick forms below and give the short 25-30 min technical assessment at the end of it

For those interested in Data Engineering role: https://lnkd.in/dywfqjHb

For those interested in the Data Science role: https://lnkd.in/dtt3FdDD

PS: You can give both the assessments and can be selected for both the roles. However moving ahead you'll have to choose one job so keep that in mind

Once completed, we’ll shortlist and provide feedback by the end of the week.
We’re building a fair, fast, and feedback-driven hiring process for global engineers, data scientists, product managers etc

Let’s make hiring transparent again 💪

Drop your email in the comments if you’re interested — or tag someone who should apply!

Hit me up if you have any questions regarding the process, salary anything else, happy to answer them. Thanks :)

Dear Data Scientist, don't be a 𝘑𝘶𝘱𝘺𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘦𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘳.

You know the profile:

ⓧ Fancy plots
ⓧ Spaghetti code
ⓧ Markdown novel

Jupyter is great for 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.
But, 𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯. 

Instead do these 𝘣𝘦𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘥 Jupyter:

✓ Write modular, testable code
✓ Use a project directory — use UV
✓ Don't email code. Version-control with Git
✓ Think reproducibility & deployment from day 1
✓ Deploy model to an endpoint on cloud and monitor

Your job isn't to make pretty notebooks.
Notebooks are where you 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘵 — not where you 𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘱.

This advice is overly simplified and outdated.
Imagine a production-grade container that can encapsulate:
- code
- documentation
- logs, output

That's exactly what a notebook *can* be used for. Lots of orgs use them in this way, and have for a while, e.g. this post from 2018:

After exploring on notebooks, refactor your logic i.e. define your functions, class/methods etc. and use the jupyter nbconvert command in your terminal to quickly convert the notebook to .py scripts. 
e.g. jupyter nbconvert cleaned_nb.ipynb --to script
Ensure you have the jupyter package installed in your environment; it has nbconvert as a dependency package.

Helping data scientists show their expertise on LinkedIn.💪🏻 Data Career Tips📈 From burnt-out data scientist to $180K+ and promoted.

10mo • 


Doing this for 30 days straight helped me land my current tech job.

(It’s simpler than you think.)

Before, I was applying blindly online, only to receive rejection emails (or nothing at all…).

Then I tried something different.

For 30 days straight, I sent one networking message per day—and it changed everything.

Here’s exactly how I did it:
1️⃣ Week 1: Find 7 people
People working at companies you admire. Start with friends, alumni, or LinkedIn connections.
2️⃣ Every morning: Send ONE message
Keep it simple: "Hey [Name], I admire your work at [Company]. I’d love to hear about your experience. Could we do a quick 15-min chat?"
3️⃣ During the call: Focus on THEM
Ask about their journey, challenges, and insights. Then, casually ask if their company has open roles.
4️⃣ If they say YES → Ask for a referral
If they say NO → Ask if they know someone at another company.
5️⃣ Repeat for 30 days.

By the end, you’ll have:
✅ Built genuine industry connections
✅ Practiced selling your skills
✅ Gotten multiple referrals (and interviews)

Most people won’t do this.
That’s why it works.

I’m putting together a FREE cohort of aspiring data scientists to help them land their first job with this exact strategy.

If you join, you’ll get:
🔹 A Telegram chat with direct access to me and a supportive community
🔹 The exact tools I used to land my current data job (such as a cool networking email template that you can find in the comments)

Want access? 
💬 Comment "Networking" if you want in.
📩 Send me a connection request so I can DM you.

Your next opportunity is one message away.… more
