The 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵 Reality Of Data Engineering Interviews These Days...

𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 in the Interview:
1st round: “Write a window function SQL query on a whiteboard. Optimize it for a billion rows. Explain multi-cloud failover.”

2nd round: “How would you partition, orchestrate, and monitor real-time CDC from 4 sources into a lakehouse… and minimize cost to zero?”

3rd round: “Design a hybrid lakehouse with S3, Delta, Iceberg, AND Hudi. Bonus: code a data contract in 10 minutes.”

Behavioral: “Tell us about a project where you did everything… alone.

The Real 2025 Data Engineering Stack:

1. Python + SQL (always)
2. One cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS)—deeply, not all three on your CV
3. Orchestration: Airflow / Prefect
4. Data warehouse: Redshift / BigQuery / Snowflake
5. Some Spark or dbt
6. Git, CLI, debugging chops

If I could give advice to every DE candidate prepping for interviews this year:
Master one real end-to-end pipeline (cloud + orchestration + warehouse + BI).

Here are 5 FREE Projects you can Practice..
1.Real-Time Taxi Ride Analytics Pipeline (NYC Data): https://lnkd.in/gEw86aNY

Most analysts waste hours translating Excel into Python & SQL. This 1-page cheat-sheet fixes that. 👇

If you work with data, you don’t need to choose Excel, Python, or SQL — you need to know when to use each. I made a single-page mapping that shows the exact equivalent for everyday tasks (load → filter → join → aggregate).

Use this flow:
• Excel to quickly explore & validate.
• SQL to extract & aggregate from databases.
• Python (Pandas) to clean, transform, and automate.

Key quick wins from the sheet:
• Filter rows — Filter → df[df['col']>100] → WHERE col > 100
• Group & aggregate — Pivot/Group → df.groupby('dept').size() → GROUP BY
• New column by condition — IF() → np.where(...) → CASE WHEN ...
• Top N rows — Sort + Filter → df.nlargest(5,'col') → SELECT TOP 5 ...

Why this matters: knowing the equivalent command saves HOURS when moving from prototype (Excel) to production (SQL/Python). It’s proven: hybrid mastery = faster delivery, fewer bugs, better dashboards.

👇 Action (do this now):

• Save this infographic for interview prep.
• Comment: SQL, Python or Excel — which do you rely on most?
• Tag one person who should see this.
• Follow Shubham Patel for more useful content related to Excel, Power BI, Python and SQL.

Today marks a huge milestone for Apexon, and one that speaks to the years of focus, rigor, and belief our teams have poured into building world‑class engineering capabilities.

Apexon has officially achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) DevOps Competency, a designation awarded only to partners who demonstrate deep technical expertise, consistent customer success, and a mature DevOps practice. 

What makes this achievement even more meaningful is that it represents our third AWS Competency in just two years, joining our Migration and Life Sciences competencies. It’s another proof point that when we commit to excellence, we deliver. 

This milestone also strengthens our collaboration with AWS. With this competency, AWS is investing in us through Marketing Development Funds to accelerate joint go‑to‑market initiatives, a huge vote of confidence in our partnership and our ability to co‑create value for clients. 

But beyond the badge, this moment is about our people.
Our engineers, architects, delivery leaders, and alliance teams continue to raise the bar. They’ve built a DevOps practice grounded in real outcomes automation that accelerates delivery, operating models that improve resilience, and solutions that help clients move from implementation to business value faster.

To everyone at Apexon and our Amazon Web Services (AWS) counterparts, thank you.
To our clients, this is another step in our promise to deliver excellence.
To our future clients, we’re just getting started.
Kavita Sharma Khandhadia amazing job!

CIS ServiceNow Certifications Matter

Strong ServiceNow support isn’t just about experience—it’s about consistency and credibility. CIS certifications validate real platform knowledge, best practices, and hands-on capability.

CIS certs help bridge the gap between “keeping the lights on” and delivering scalable, high-quality solutions. They improve troubleshooting, reduce rework, and build trust with stakeholders. That is value. 

In short: better skills, better support, better outcomes. If you are struggling to find a new role, this would be a great area to start learning.

Machine Learning is at the core of modern data-driven solutions, but understanding which algorithm to use and when is key. Here’s a clear breakdown to guide your journey:

Machine Learning Certification Course :- https://lnkd.in/dXbU5Ck5

1️⃣ Supervised Learning
Predict outcomes using labeled data.

Classification: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree

Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multivariate Regression, Lasso Regression

2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
Discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, Independent Component Analysis

Association: Frequent Pattern Growth, Apriori Algorithm

Anomaly Detection: Z-score Algorithm, Isolation Forest

3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning
A hybrid approach using partially labeled data.

Classification: Self-Training

Regression: Co-Training

4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
Learn through trial and error by interacting with the environment.

Model-Free: Policy Optimization, Q-Learning

Model-Based: Learn the Model, Given the Model

💡 Whether you're starting with supervised methods or exploring advanced reinforcement learning, these algorithms form the backbone of any data scientist’s toolkit.

📊 Data Analyst vs Data Scientist — Which Path Fits You Best? 🤔
These two roles are often confused, but the difference is huge.
This simple breakdown makes it crystal clear 👇
🔵 DATA ANALYST
📌 Focus: Understanding what happened and why
📊 Work With: Structured data (SQL tables, Excel, dashboards)
🎯 Goal: Support business decisions with insights
🛠 Tools: Excel | SQL | Tableau | Power BI
📉 Skills: Data cleaning, basic statistics, visualization
🤖 Machine Learning: ❌ Not required
📤 Output: Dashboards, KPIs, business reports
❓ Key Questions:
• What happened?
• Why did it happen?
🎓 Career Path: Great entry point into data & analytics roles
👉 Perfect if you enjoy storytelling with data and helping businesses make smarter decisions.

🟡 DATA SCIENTIST
📌 Focus: Predicting what will happen next
📊 Work With: Large, complex, sometimes unstructured data
🎯 Goal: Build predictive & intelligent systems
🛠 Tools: Python | TensorFlow | Scikit-learn | Spark
📉 Skills: Statistics, experimentation, modeling
🤖 Machine Learning: ✅ Core responsibility
📤 Output: ML models, forecasts, recommendation engines
❓ Key Questions:
• What will happen?
• How can we optimize it?
🎓 Career Path: Requires deeper technical & math expertise
👉 Ideal if you love math, models, and solving problems at scale.
💬 So, which one are you choosing — Analyst or Scientist?

Data is most powerful when it tells a clear story.

Sharing a Power BI Consumer Sales Performance report where I focused on solving real business reporting problems, not just building visuals.

Business problems addressed:
 – Understanding sales and return performance across time
 – Identifying top-performing products dynamically
 – Analyzing category and age-group revenue contribution without cluttering the main report
What I implemented:
 – Built a dedicated calendar table and applied time-intelligence logic for MTD, MoM, and cumulative analysis
 – Implemented field parameters to dynamically select top N products and analyze their sales impact across categories
 – Designed multiple custom tooltips to surface detailed insights such as total orders, revenue, quantity sold, and return orders at date level
 – Created an age-group analysis tooltip to evaluate category-wise revenue contribution and highlight each category’s top product with revenue
 – Developed key KPIs including total orders, revenue, return metrics, average order value, and order ratios
 – Performed end-to-end data modeling and wrote optimized DAX measures to ensure accuracy and performance.

Every feature in this report was implemented to answer a specific business question, not just to display metrics.

This project demonstrates my ability to translate business questions into scalable Power BI solutions with strong data modeling, DAX.

Thanks to Vinayak Kadam for providing a challenging dataset. 

If you are a recruiter or part of a talent acquisition team and believe my skills align with your requirements, I’d be happy to connect and discuss data-related opportunities. I’m currently open to work.

Sunday night you use ChatGPT and it feels like magic. Monday morning you log into your company's enterprise software and the magic is gone.

There's this feeling that millions of people experience every week.

Sunday night, you're on the couch. You open ChatGPT. You ask it to plan a trip, summarize a book, debug some code. It's seamless. It feels like magic.

Monday morning, you log into your workplace AI agent.

The magic is gone. The interface is clunky. The latency is brutal. The search can't find a document you saved yesterday.

We've handed the average teenager a Ferrari. We're asking the Fortune 500 to drive a Model T.

The assumption in Silicon Valley is that this gap closes naturally—bigger models fix everything.

I don't think so. I think it closes when we stop building horizontal and start building vertical. When we stop optimizing for breadth and start optimizing for depth.

That Monday morning feeling isn't going away on its own.

Apexon Ignite recently participated in the Gujarat CSR & ESG Collaborative 2026–30, hosted by CSRBOX®, bringing together leaders from CSR, ESG, industry, academia, and the development sector for a forward-looking roundtable discussion.

Our very own Geetanjali Sahni moderated a high-impact conversation focused on sectoral learnings across skilling, health, education, environment, and livelihoods. The discussion encouraged candid exchanges on how organizations can drive scalable, outcome-oriented CSR in the 2026–2030 horizon.

During the collaborative forum, Geetanjali Sahni and Pravinsinh Rathod engaged with leaders across diverse sectors—sharing insights, exchanging ideas, and exploring opportunities to amplify community impact through cross-sector partnerships.

The roundtable also highlighted the need for:
-Cluster-based collaboration models
-Stronger public–private partnerships
-Shared action on regional priorities
-Practical strategies for long-term, sustainable development

A heartfelt appreciation to CSRBOX® for curating such an inspiring platform that champions collaboration, learning, and meaningful change.
